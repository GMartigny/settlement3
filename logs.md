I'll use this for to dump all my ideas and thinking process all along the development. This is not going to be pretty, but I hope it will help with saving history and explain my choices.


## 29/08/2023 The start

The other day, I couldn't sleep because I was too eager to start this project. I'm currently on the bus to Kuala Lumpur after a 10 months trip around the world. Honestly, I really miss development.
About 7 years ago (2016) I started to create my first ambitious game idea; [Settlement](https://github.com/GMartigny/settlement). Sadly, I abandoned it. It has became too difficult to maintain because of my lack of experience and outdated build technologies (Grunt).
In 2020, with some experience with Vue.js, I [revive the project](https://github.com/GMartigny/settlement2). However, I quickly give up again. Vue is not really made to create games. Fighting to bend it to my needs was tiring. Also, I guess the will was not really there.
So, third time the charm I hope. The goal will be to ship a working prototype as soon as possible to avoid scope creep like the first time. Secondly, I choose to create my own "game engine". I don't need anything complicated and it will be more flexible this way. I also hope to learn a bit about JS framework creation.
Before coming back home, I will try to lay down all I need to do for a fun and engaging version 1 and gather some building material.
